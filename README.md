FaceQnet: Quality Assessment for Face Recognition based on Deep Learning

This repository contains the DNN FaceQnet presented in the paper: "FaceQnet: Quality Assessment for Face Recognition based on Deep Learning".

FaceQnet is a No-Reference, end-to-end Quality Assessment (QA) system for face recognition based on deep learning. 
The system consists of a Convolutional Neural Network that is able to predict the suitability of a specific input image for face recognition purposes. 
The training of FaceQnet is done using the VGGFace2 database.
